# StopWatch

This is a Fronted Project for which I have used Just Javascript, CSS, and HTML

In Javascript, I have used setInterval and clearInterval, so when I click on start the time in my stopwatch is increased every second
I have also used Font Awesome for adding Icons for my stopwatch and Google Fonts for adding fonts.
